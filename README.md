# Badger-Radio-Podcast
An audio series meant to reveal what badger finance has to offer to the world, laying a proper foundation about crypto and building up to Badger finance, this series is meant to give regular updates on what's new on Badger DAO and the exciting opportunities therein

this podcast will be aired on Spotify, RadioPublic, Google Podcast, Breaker and CopyRSS

Media of publicity will be via Twitter, Telegram, Discord and Facebook.

The podcast series is to be like a global badger radio, releasing premium content to the world with proper publicity and enriching the media with adequate education every 3 Days. Understanding what Badger finance is all about will surely help people embrace her the more. And they can’t understand badger without understanding crypto, blockchain technology,and DeFi. That is why I created an all inclusive curriculum, layed a proper foundation on Crypto, Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Finance, then built from there, I found this paramount because out of the few adopters of crypto in the world today (less than 4% global adoption), less than 45% actually know what blockchain Technology is all about. this has as a result fueled a lot of bad choices and led to many losing a lot of resources and that is not good for a young industry like the crypto industry.

OBJECTIVES OF THE PODCAST SERIES;
• Crypto Adoption
• Blockchain Enlightenment
• Reveal the best Crypto projects to Invest in
• Badger Finance revealed
• Help the world outside crypto understand how they can be both enlightened and financially empowered in crypto through Badger Financed projects
• Help unadopters get involved in the crypto industry and become profitable in the long run.

Where better to spread the good news than via different streams of media, because half the world are on the internet, in your phones, in your pocket. statistics from the research conducted by Oberlo shows that 71% of internet users who have a good experience with a brand on their social media are likely to recommend that brand to their friends and family. 4% of millennials, 77.5% of Generation X and 48.2% of baby boomers are enthusiastic social media users.

So I started on social media with intensions of advancing to other forms of digital publicity when resourses are available, reaching everyone who cares to listen and in turn contributing to the growth of the BadgerDAO community.

It is worthy of note, that the traffic generated or attention drawn toward this podcast series, though not much was completely organic and not manipulated, and with the necessary support and resources, will surely go places. spreading the word on BadgerDAO and the Crypto and blockchain Industry at large.

Also, the podcast series will go on, even after the Hackerton ends until the existing curriculum ends in about a week+ and the link below will host all the episodes of the podcast series while individual episodes of the podcast in the duration of the hackerton had been uploaded duely;
